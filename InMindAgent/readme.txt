The Learning by Instruction Agent (LIA) client is an agent that can learn new tasks. Written in Android Studio.

It is recommended to install the LIA client on a stationary phone that is connected constantly to the outlet and has both a microphone and speaker connected to it with a splitter (e.g. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MPZGF6N
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MPZGF6N
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HEYIPGK). This way LIA can be called using its wakeup keyword: EXCLAMATION, form a distance. Note that allowing the use of a wakeup keyword (EXCLAMATION) locks the microphone, so no other app can use the microphone (e.g. video recorder, Google Now, Skype or WhatsAPP call etc.), there is a button in LIA's client GUI to disable the wakeup keyword and release the microphone.

For smoothly playing YouTube songs/videos (by saying for example "play strawberry fields"), it is recommended to install Cygery AdSkip Youtube ads [from: https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-cygery-adskip-youtube-xda-exclusive-t3361271 (or video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nXgNCD3BO8)

In order to teach by demonstration, one should also install Sugilite:https://github.com/tobyli/Sugilite


List of features:
- learning by natural language / demonstration (either say something LIA doesn't know how to execute and then say yes when she asks if you would like to teach her, or explicitly say that you want to teach her a new command).
- defining new concepts (e.g. "define concept contact"), creating new fields (e.g. "a contact has an email") creating new instances (e.g. "John is a contact", "John's email is john@john2.com"), retrieving that information (e.g. "what is John's email").
- forget all learned
- email operations (read inbox emails, compose new emails): requires setting email and password
- say something (especially useful when teaching new commands, e.g. "Thank you", "say you are welcome")
- play YouTube videos/songs (e.g. "play strawberry fields")
- News (e.g. "science news")
- Factoid questions (e.g. "who is the president of the united states")
- Spell words (e.g. "spell elephant")

Under development:
- Timers (under development)
- Alarms (under development)
- Current time.
- Calculations (e.g. how much is twenty seven times forty three point two?) Inc. time calculations (under development)
- Weather (under development)
- Conditional execution (under development)
