The Learning by Instruction Agent (LIA) client is an agent that can learn new tasks. Written in Android Studio.

It is recommended to install the LIA client on a stationary phone that is connected constantly to the outlet and has both a microphone and speaker connected to it with a splitter (e.g. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MPZGF6N
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MPZGF6N
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HEYIPGK). This way LIA can be called using its wakeup keyword: JESSICA, form a distance. Note that allowing the use of a wakeup keyword (JESSICA) locks the microphone, so no other app can use the microphone (e.g. video recorder, Google Now, Skype or WhatsAPP call etc.), there is a button in LIA's client GUI to disable the wakeup keyword and release the microphone (by default LIA does NOT listen for a keyword).

For smoothly playing YouTube songs/videos (by saying for example "play strawberry fields"), it is recommended to install Cygery AdSkip Youtube ads [from: https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-cygery-adskip-youtube-xda-exclusive-t3361271 (or video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nXgNCD3BO8)

In order to teach by demonstration, one should also install Sugilite:https://github.com/tobyli/Sugilite


List of features:
- learning by natural language / demonstration (either say something LIA doesn't know how to execute and then say yes when she asks if you would like to teach her, or explicitly say that you want to teach her a new command).
- defining new concepts (e.g. "define concept contact"), creating new fields (e.g. "a contact has an email") creating new instances (e.g. "John is a contact", "John's email is john@john2.com"), retrieving that information (e.g. "what is John's email").
- forget all learned
- undo
- email operations (read inbox emails, compose new emails): requires setting email and password
- say something (especially useful when teaching new commands, e.g. "Thank you", "say you are welcome")
- play YouTube videos/songs (e.g. "play strawberry fields")
- News (e.g. "science news")
- Factoid questions (e.g. "who is the president of the united states")
- Spell words (e.g. "spell elephant")
- Timers (set a timer for 5 minutes with message go home. Or: tell me to go home in 5 minutes, remind me to take the cake out of the over in an hour)
- Alarms (e.g. set an alarm for tomorrow 7am. read timers/alarms, cancel timers/alarms, cancel 6 am alarm)
- Current time/date (what's the time? What's the date?).
- Change wake-up phrase (in settings): pick "Change Wakeup Phrase" from the menu and enter your new wakeup phrase (it can be composed of several words, make sure it isn't too short!).

Under development:
- Calculations (e.g. how much is twenty seven times forty three point two plus twelve?) Inc. time calculations (under development)
- Weather (under development)
- Conditional execution (under development)
